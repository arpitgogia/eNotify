My first Node.JS project. Trying to implement a simple mailing list for college admin staff to notify students upon release of important notices. Inspired by personal experience of the Admin Dept. at DTU.

Running the Web App
-------------------
1. Clone the repo
2. ```cd``` to the root directory
3. Install the dependencies using ```npm install```
4. Make sure you are running a MongoDB Instance. On Linux, use ```mongod start``` to start a MongoDB instance. On Windows, use ```mongod --dbpath <PATH_TO_DB>```.
5. Run using ```npm start```
6. Open ```http://localhost:3000``` in the browser
